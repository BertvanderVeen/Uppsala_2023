# Uppsala 2023
Material for my visit to Uppsala in April 2023. 

"Presentation" includes [my slides](https://bertvanderveen.github.io/Uppsala_2023/presentation_25_04_2023/index.html) for the seminar of Tuesday 25-04, with a timeline of historical ordination developments that I constructed for this occassion.
I am happy for anyone to re-use that timeline, just provide appropriate credit (as it took quite some work). If I have forgotten methods or important conceptual developments, please post an issue on this github repo (or PR) and I will amend it.

Workshop participants that are unfamiliar with model-based ordination I advise to read [Warton et al. 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534715002402), and potentially [Hui et al. 2015](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12236).
