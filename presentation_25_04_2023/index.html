&lt;!--
2) Looking back: community ecology once was on the frontier, doing the quantitative push (see e.g., refs that say so; Austin 1985, Walker 2015 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-015-0467-7#Sec2, Ovaskainen &amp; Abrego pp 30)
  - Ordination was one of the few methods available for multivariate techniques (OK, besides clusttering methods)
  - Was recognized by ter Braak and Gauch in the 80s, but computational power was missing (Warton, Walker)
  - These days, there are much more statistical methods available for multivariate analysis:
    - e.g., HMMs, Mixture models, V/MGLMs, GLLVMs, not to mention all kinds of network approaches from machine learning
    - Ordination is still most applied multivariate method in ecology (Ovaskainen &amp; Abrego)
  - Now ordination is deemed descriptive: Ovaskainen and Abrego (pp), yet it is still a very useful tool for many ecologists
  - However, it is not "cool" anymore. But easy to understand and use.
  - ter Braak and prentice: many methods are heuristic but useful in practice.
3) In this presentation, I will make the point that ordination is/can be still quantitative. Yet development has stalled a little
  - many new flavors of existing techniques, but few new ones (ok, PRC and work by Yee) but it isn't adopted for some reason
  - This push comes from community ecology and is not recent (Jackson, hui, Boral, Warton)
  - Partly based on the JSDM crowd
  - partly because "classical methods" have been shown to be bad (distance metrics and such).
4) We go back a little. Jackson and the JSDM from Pollock (also mention their examples)
  - Has come from the intention to study "biotic interactions" and for binary data, i.e., to predict occurrence
  - However, cannot be inferred from JSDMs, yet they have on the rise! Ordination is neglected.
  - Ovaskainen connected the JSDM to proper ecological foundations
  - Warton et al. 2015: We are now entering a third phase in methods for multivariate analysis in ecology. This has been driven by the advent of sophisticated hierarchical modeling tools, a watershed for complex problems that arise in ecology 
  
5) I (with  others) have been working on the ordination side. Because correlation plots are useless
- Difference between JSDMs and Ordination? Spatial scale and crowd. Yet they are the same!
  - ordination has long since focussed not only on pres/ab, but also on measures of frequency
- Either how, JSDMs are used in a narrow field while ordination is used in many fields, beyond community ecology
  - e.g., quantitative genetics, morphometrics, toxicology, but also the social sciences
- The main goal of this has been to make new ordination methods more available and suitable for ecologists
- We have an R package that does this quickly, but there are also other software implementations
6) The last chapter of my PhD suggests the new hierarchical ordination model
- I see this as an overarching framework, it can include different sources on data
  - in community ecology abundance, environment, traits, phylogeny and space
  - or quantitative genetics, measures of traits (on individuals) with measures of individuals (X), predictors of traits (environment?), relatedness of individuals and correlation between traits (phenotypic correlation)
    - species and individuals
  - or spatiotemporal, or many more applications are included
- It includes a lot of complex components, but should the ideal combination of ecology, complex statistical methodology, and easy-to-use application/inference
6) The point is not that these methods are "new" but that they function better! And give more flexibility to answer ecological questions that we have
- This does come at a cost; steeper learning curve, software is in active development, etc.
- But, for teaching that is helpful as it provides a unified framework: glm/mglm - glmm/JSDM (mglmm) - Ordination

7) Where to next? Wide-scale use and phasing out of classical methods.
- gives the field a new method to rally around
- pushing the statistical practice and giving the opportunity for new/better ecology
- a new  framework to center typical multivariate studies around. Not to reinvent the ecology but to improve the anlaysis.
- Pauyl Walker aready said it; the field is stuck with methods from the 80s, not moving on. Stagnant.
- This framework has the potential to change that. To revitalize the field. Like lme4 has done, and MCMCGLMM for phylogenetics.
8) Part of a bigger push for better statistical practices in community ecology, more process-based less metric-based.?&gt;

# Use of ordination
 
 - One of the most used methods of multivariate analysis in ecology (but definitely not the only one)
- To arrange species and samples in a low-dimensional space
  - or any column and row quantity really
- Summarize data
- In order to find underlying structures (gradients - process based)

# In the begnning, there were PCA and FA

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="1080" /&gt;

???

make a point that some of these methods have been out for a long time (constrained, unconstrained).

---

# Then, CA was developed
&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="1080" /&gt;

???

- important because precursor to many methods
- also still what we work on now

---

# Next, reduced rank regression

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="1080" /&gt;

???

- first model-based ordination method

---

# Then, there was "Ordination"

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="1080" /&gt;

???

- PO: first real ecological method
- whittaker first observed approximate Gaussian responses: start of process-based thinking (see also next slide)

---


# Whittaker 1956: Unimodal responses

&lt;img src="Whittaker_1956_quadratic.png" width="60%" height="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

- Whittaker (1956) observed unimodal responses
- Approximately "Gaussian"
- Spiked process-based thinking for ordination methods


---

# Ordination became popular

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="1080" /&gt;

???

- It was part of a push for more quantitative methods
- Computers were on the rage, 
- NMDS was still considered "computationally intensive"

---

# Mark Hill's contributions

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="1080" /&gt;

- DCA was developed
- MIMIC

???

- DCA is still a competitor for us
- MIMIC was reduced rankr egression + factor analysis of covariance matrix
  - important, because again precusor model-basde methods

---

# CTB did his PhD

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="1080" /&gt;

- The unimodal model continued

???

- Canoco was (I think) first "easy to use" software, instead of just a bunch fo fortran routines
- (long since abandoned now, by most)

---

# Unimodal model (2)

&lt;img src="Gauch_et_al_1974.png" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
&lt;img src="terBraak_1985.png" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


???

- unimodal model was adopted for ordination
- formulated the "Gaussian" (quadratic) model
  - too difficult/unstable to fit
- CA was "approximate" MLE
  - lacked typical model-based measures
- Supported by McArthur's work (lotka volterra)

---

# NMDS was shown to be "better"

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="1080" /&gt;

- The unimodal model
- Development of CCA

???

- Than DCA (people already didn't like CA for its faults)

---

# Are species response curves symmetric?

&lt;img src="Minchin_1987.png" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Skewed might be more realistic
- NMDS is "robust"
- Moving away from process-based


???

- motivated by process-based thinking (not unimodal model)
- but not process-based/worse interpretation!
- I think a mistake.

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="1080" /&gt;

- Probabilistic PCA
- vegan!

???

- Process-based thinking went out of the window..

---

# Development of ordination methods

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/timeline-1.png" width="1080" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- And then things went quiet(er)
- Ordination became "descriptive" and uncool

---

# Ordination is well established

- one of the successes currently: so many resources!
  - vegan, anadat
  - many books, websites (Michael Palmer, David Zeleney)
  - I.e., run a search and you will find the answer
- Contemporary ordination methods, not so much (yet)

---


# Nothing since the 90s?

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/timeline2-1.png" width="1080" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- this is where most courses broadly stop
- Dun dun dun.. stagnation (courses in Norway still teach only methods from 90s)

???

- But the development for R and computational advances have changed the outlook
- resources do not include new developments
- courses still taught the same way as 20 years ago (ok, now with R)

- An incomplete timeline
- Not my expertise and not very widespread (yet)

???

- has potential
- only a few applications in ecology currently (see ref UMAP and roberts t-SNE)
- have their role, but for summarizing dataset
- not for ecological inference/process-based thinking

---

# Eigenanalysis-based methods

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/timeline4b-1.png" width="1080" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- had few conceptual advances
- slowed down quite a bit since the 80s

# Timeline model-based ordination

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/timeline5-1.png" width="1080" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- still a little crowded
- a very active field

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="Ovaskainen_et_al_2017_2.png" width="99%" height="99%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

???

- Connected the model to the ecology
- And the data to the model/ecological questions

---

# Joint Species Distribution Modeling (2)

- A niche process generates data
- Distributions are driven by 1) environment and 2) interactions
- Statistically, interaction = correlation of species
- So we model that:

`\begin{equation}
g(\text{E}(y_{ij}|\boldsymbol{X}_i)) = \beta_{0j} + \boldsymbol{X}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\beta}_j + \color{red}{\epsilon_{ij}}, \qquad \color{red}{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)
\end{equation}`

- Can be fit using standard mixed-effects modeling software.

.center[.font120[In &lt;tt&gt;lme4&lt;/tt&gt;: &lt;br&gt; `glmer(abundance~species+x:species+(0+species|sites),family="poisson",data=data)`]]

???
- just a multivariate model (swap species with really anything else)
Otso/Pollock
- process-based thinking but different angle? Correlation.
- Ordination went on hold a bit after that, but enter..JSDM/biotic interactions!
- if before we thought of these as separate glms, they are now connected

---

# "Fun" ecological inference

&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="Warton_2015_alpineplants.jpg" alt="Warton et al. 2015 Alpine plants" width="55%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Warton et al. 2015 Alpine plants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

- but, `\(\Sigma\)` has `\(p(p+1)/2\)` parameters (which increases quadratically with # species)
- JSDMs usually converge horribly and are slow to fit

---

class: clear

## Enter: Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models

- GLLVM for short
- Add "factor analytic" structure to `\(\Sigma\)`
- `\(\color{red}{\epsilon_{ij}} = \boldsymbol{u}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\theta}_j\)`
  - i.e. `\(\color{red}{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\boldsymbol{\theta}_j\boldsymbol{\theta}_j^\top)\)`
- Faster and fewer parameters:
  - Number of parameter doesn't grow so fast

`\begin{equation}
\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
 \theta_{11} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 \theta_{12} &amp; \theta_{22} &amp; 0 \\
 \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp;  \vdots \\
 \theta_{1j} &amp; \cdots &amp; \theta_{dj} 
 \end{bmatrix}
 \begin{bmatrix}
 \theta_{11} &amp; \theta_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp;  \theta_{1j} \\
  0 &amp; \theta_{22} &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; \theta_{dj}
 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}`

???

- more formal way of doing ordination
- GLLVMs are for FA what GLMs are for LM

???

- OK, but then we are at the same place?
- yes but no; model is super flexible and more complex than any other ordination method
- it is a next step in the evolution of ordination
- Ignores 100 years ordination method developments
- e.g., a linear model!!, we see that next


---

# Huh, this is ordination

- More dimensions, better estimation of `\(\Sigma\)`
- Each dimension is a "latent variable" so ordination!

&lt;img src="REord_Jackson_2011.png" width="90%" height="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


???

- Eek this doesn't work - enter GLLVM
- Gauch et al. 1974 already connected ordination with SDM, but this has long since forgotten
- Not until 2015 was this better recognized?

class:clear,middle,center

## Since then

&lt;img src="Pichler_Hartig_2021.png" width="90%" height="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Compared model-based with NMDS &amp; t-SNE
- Distance-based outperformed model-based (Boral, REO)
- A fued was born?
- My opion: the way that Roberts did his analysis was weird, and does not give an accurate picture

# Return of the unimodal model

&lt;img src="vdVeenQuadratic.png" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Species responses are not linear
- So we created an unimodal model

`\begin{equation}
\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \boldsymbol{z}_i^\top\boldsymbol{\gamma}_j \color{red}{- \boldsymbol{z}_i\boldsymbol{D}_k\boldsymbol{z}_i}
\end{equation}`

???

- first thing in PhD: update Cajo his work from 80s

- true model was neither of these
- linear gllvm different dist and row-effects
- i.e., the story on response curves was meh
- just poor methods were applied

I think: &lt;br&gt;
1) Model-based methods generally outperform distance-based methods &lt;br&gt;
2) Model-based methods are conceptually superior &lt;br&gt;
3) Model-based methods should be preferred

???

though lvm + distance is kind of interesting.

&lt;img src="Yee_CAO_2004.png" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Yee was busy developing new methods for constrained ordination
- was never really adopted for some reason

# Concurrent ordination

- van der Veen et al. 2022
- Combines recent developments in model-based constrained &amp; unconstrained ordination
- As well as historical push for unimodal models
- Constrained ordination with random-effects

`\begin{equation}
\eta_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \boldsymbol{z}_i^\top\boldsymbol{\gamma}_j
\end{equation}`

with `\(\boldsymbol{z_i} = \boldsymbol{B}^\top\boldsymbol{x}_i + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_i\)`

- can be extended with unimodal model

--

&lt;img src="van_der_Veen_et_al_2022.png" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


???

All that was left was to combine things;
- constrained ordination with RE
- and concurrent ordination
- I think major conceptual development
- If variance of residual&gt;0 canonical coefs will be biased
- truely a linear regression unlike constrained ordination (that requires perfect representation)

&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-43-1.png" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

- could be used to determine if there are species groups for which covariates are missing..
- for everything else, pretty useless

---

# Model-based ordination
- more flexible &amp; statistically appropriate
- now straightforward available
- very much in active development
- has a steep learning curve &amp; computational difficulties

Allows us to do all kinds of fun things
- Residual diagnostics
- Species-specific effecs from constrained ordination
- Random-effects
- Flexible models
- Etc.

---

# Classical ordination `\(\approx\)` model-based 

- PCA `\(\approx\)` Gaussian linear GLLVM
- CA `\(\approx\)` Poisson/Bernoulli/Gamma linear GLLVM
- CCA `\(\approx\)` constrained GLLVM

&lt;b&gt;But model-based ordination is much more flexible than that &lt;/b&gt;

# My vision

- I really wanted to combine traits &amp; phylogeny (and space and time) with ordination
- So we can make quadriplots
- More complex flavor of double constrained ordination
- Framework that is applicable to a wide variety of ecological subfields

???

- i.e., combine 5 data matrices
- ordination with multiple datasets has been done in the past
- and this is similar to dCCA that CTB recently developed
- I see this as an overarching framework, it can include different sources on data
  - in community ecology abundance, environment, traits, phylogeny and space
  - or quantitative genetics, measures of traits (on individuals) with measures of individuals (X), predictors of traits (environment?), relatedness of individuals and correlation between traits (phenotypic correlation)
    - species and individuals
  - or spatiotemporal, or many more applications are included
- It includes a lot of complex components, but should the ideal combination of ecology, complex statistical methodology, and easy-to-use application/inference

# Hierarchical ordination

- in form much more similar to classical ordination
- but with all model-based jazz

`\begin{aligned}
\eta_{ij} &amp;= \beta_{0j} + \color{red}{\boldsymbol{z}_i}^\top\color{brown}{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}\color{blue}{\boldsymbol{\gamma}_j} \\
\color{red}{\boldsymbol{z}_i} &amp;= \boldsymbol{B}^\top\boldsymbol{x}_i + \boldsymbol{b}^\top\boldsymbol{u}_j + \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \\
\color{blue}{\boldsymbol{\gamma}_j} &amp;= \boldsymbol{\omega}^\top\boldsymbol{T}_j + \boldsymbol{w}^\top\boldsymbol{\lambda}_i + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
\end{aligned}`

- `\(\color{brown}{\Sigma}\)` are a type of singular values under correct standardization

# HO &amp; the postdoc

- HO is a framework that includes many different models
  - Concurrent ordination
  - Constrained ordination
  - Double constrained ordination
  - Uconstrained ordination
  
## My vision
- A package for multivariate multilevel analysis in ecology
  - To "phase out" methods that perform poorly
- With a simple, formula-based interface (lme4-type)
  - for both LVs and loadings
- Hopefully fast to fit

???
- I do not have the angle/view that it is "bad", "dirty", "not quantitative" or "descriptive"
  - why can't we include random-effects
  - why can't we adopt process-based thinking
  - why shouldn't we use proper statistics
  - we are only limited by our imagination in these developments (OK, it does require some stubborness)
- ordination IS one of the most popular methods in ecology so why aren't people moving onto the new methods en mass?

---


# The plan

1) Develop new and easy-to-use software 
(R-package) &lt;br&gt;
2) The necessary mathematical and statistical machinery &lt;br&gt;
3) Apply to examples in community ecology, animal behavior, or quantitative genetics &lt;br&gt;

- HO is the ordination frontier
- It needs to be further developed / finished, and a good software implementation

???

- Software and usability is so critical in ecology
(see canoco, twinspan, primer, vegan, lme4, mvabund, Boral, gllvm, RCIM, ecoCopula, all the frameworks maybe separate timeline)
- The fact that the software doesnt exist doesnt mean the method isnt there, but it isnt adopted (constrained NMDS)

---

# Plenty of challenges

- Complex model
  - products of random-effects
  - identifiability
- No analytical solution (need approximate methods)
- Computationally intensive (need fast fitting)
- Non-convex objective function (need robust optimization)
- Usability needs a lot of thought

---

class:clear,middle,center

## Possible syntax


```r
ordinate(y ~ pred1 + (1|ID),
         cols ~ pred2 + (pred3|treatment),
         rows ~ pred4, 
         colsCov = P, rowsCov = expCor(S),
         dim = 2, family = ...)
```

--

- Random-effects help to explore LV-level residual
- Fixed-effects for the rest

---

# Towards the end

- I think model-based ordination is the way, but not quite there yet
- developments are very active and we need researchers to push the frontier
  - ask new questions
  - show that existing methods are insufficient
  - apply new advances
  - update the course material
- computation is again an active topic.
- learning curve can be/is steep
  - ordination should now be taught differently. The model-based angle

---

# Conclusion 

- A fourth corner model, MGLM, SEM, JSDM, ordination
- Incorporate different types of data
- Decompose different sources of residual covariance
- A framework for multivariate multilevel analysis in ecology
- Bonus: can make fancy bi/tri/quadri-plots

Ordination is so &lt;b&gt;much&lt;/b&gt; more than "a descriptive method"&lt;br&gt;
It is a framework for complex (reduced rank) multivariate statistical modeling
